# pandas-Optimization-Tutorial
At the INFORMS Conference on Business Analytics and Operations Research in Baltimore, Irv Lustig of Princeton Consultants gave a workshop on April 15, 2018, on how to use *pandas* in an optimization context. 

Here is the abstract from that workshop:

> The Python library *pandas* (http://pandas.pydata.org/) is popular with data scientists, who use it to carry out an entire data analysis workflow in Python. When building analytics models, we often work with data in tables that are sourced from databases, CSV files, and spreadsheets. pandas provides a uniform environment for working with data tables with a large number of methods for manipulating tabular data, many of which are directly applicable for building large scale optimization models. In this workshop, Irv Lustig will present an introduction to pandas and illustrate some of its powerful features that can accelerate optimization model development and deployment.

This project on GitHub provides a copy of the slides, as well as the Python notebooks used to illustrate the concepts.

Note that the optimization examples depend on the *optipandas* library that is in development by Princeton Consultants.  Contact [Irv Lustig](mailto:irv@princeton.com) if you are interested in that library.
